# **App Name**: The Degenerate Lord's Bad Ass Arty Calculator (⌐▨_▨)=ε/̵͇̿̿/'̿'̿ ̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ (╥﹏╥)

## Core Features:

- Weapon System Input: Allow users to select specific NATO indirect fire weapon systems (e.g., M777, AS90).
- Data Input: Input fields for all necessary parameters: target coordinates, weapon coordinates, elevation, ammunition type, charge, projectile type, and meteorological data.
- Offline Ballistic Calculation: Perform precise ballistic calculations tailored to the selected weapon system, completely offline.  Needs to use real firing solutions for an M777
- Online Weather Integration: When online, automatically fetch weather and wind data from online sources using inputted coordinates.
- Solution Display: Display the firing solution clearly: elevation, azimuth, time of flight, and range.
- Generative Solution Refinement: Use generative AI as a tool to subtly refine the firing solution based on known biases of specific weapon systems and ammunition combinations to account for minor discrepancies. Provide options to use standard ballistic calculations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray-blue (#455A64) to evoke a professional, military feel.
- Background color: Very light gray-blue (#ECEFF1), a desaturated version of the primary.
- Accent color: A muted gold (#A1887F), which is analogous to gray-blue, providing contrast and highlighting important information.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different parameters and weapon systems.
- Design a clean, uncluttered layout that emphasizes data entry and output clarity.
- Subtle transitions between data entry fields and results display.
