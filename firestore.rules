/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the firing-solution application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for firing solutions,
 * ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 * Weapon system data is public and accessible to all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /weaponSystems/{weaponSystemId}: Public collection of weapon system data.
 * - /users/{userId}/firingSolutions/{firingSolutionId}: Private collection of user-specific firing solutions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Firing solutions are stored as subcollections of users to ensure path-based
 *   ownership and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive coordinate data.
 * - Public read access is granted to the `weaponSystems` collection, as this data
 *   is intended to be available to all users.
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data structure uses path-based ownership to avoid the need for complex
 * authorization logic or database lookups. The `userId` in the path of the
 * `firingSolutions` subcollection directly corresponds to the authenticated
 * user's UID, simplifying security rules and improving performance.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Private user data (firing solutions) is stored in a user-specific
 * subcollection, while public data (weapon systems) is stored in a top-level
 * collection. This separation simplifies security rules and improves
 * performance for list operations.
